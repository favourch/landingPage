                      <p>Enterprise app distribution refers to the process of making your apps readily available to your enterprise people who need them. Apart from distribution, you can also upgrade and audit your apps in a powerful and safe manner. With the increasing demand for mobile devices and tablets, the popularity of enterprise apps is improving day by day. Such apps help employees work away from offices using their own preferred devices. However, these apps cannot be distributed normally through app stores. They are distributed privately to the people that are connected to your enterprise. You can email these apps to your team, upload them on to an internal server or distribute them through a third party service. The last option is the one that is referred to as enterprise app distribution.</p>
